# Corgi-Time
Olivia Bobrownicki

a creative, non-numeric clock for an application to Intro to Data Visualization

The Corgi Clock represents the time of the day using a running corgi, clouds, stars, the sun, and the moon. Each second, a running corgi travels 13.17 pixels across the screen. At the end of each minute, the corgi returns to the right side of the screen and a cloud appears. After 60 minutes, the sky clears and the sun moves across the horizon.

As the day progresses, the sky darkens. Once night falls, the sun is replaced by the moon and the clouds by stars. These landscape cues help the viewer interpret time as not only a number, but also a visual experience of space.
